# Tricount like mobile

> The goal of this app is to reproduce a "tricount like" page where we can add expenses associated to users and amount, see the total, and filter them.
> The app should be usable on a Tablet device (768 x 1024) and tested as such.

## Run the project

To run this project, clone it locally, install the dependencies (`yarn` or `npm i`), then start it with `yarn start` or `npm run start`.
Once built, the app will be accessible on the `3000` port. (Normally it will automatically open your browser on the right address :wink:).
